# wine-water
Consider the following riddle: you have two almost-full glasses: one with wine and one with water. Because the wine is too strong, you decide to mix the wine with water in a half-half ratio. You don't have any other container to do this. How would you go about solving it?
My answer (to my own problem): is the pour the wine into the water, then water to wine in an infinite loop. Because each time you will increase the ratio of wine/water in the glass you're pouring to, you'll finally reach the balance state.
This is a project to simulate the act of constantly pouring, but with some more graphics for fun.
Later on I used this to simulate osmosis phenomenon as well.
